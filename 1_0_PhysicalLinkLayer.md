# PHYSICAL LAYER

- Responsible for transmitting raw bits (0s and 1s) over a physical medium such as cables or wireless.
- Converts binary data into physical signals.
- Defines the hardware characteristics like Cable types (coaxial, twisted pair, fiber optic)
- Data Rate Control : Specifies how many bits per second can be sent (bit rate).
- Ensures sender and receiver are synchronized in timing.
- Topology & Transmission Mode
- Line Configuration
