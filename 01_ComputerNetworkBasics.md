HOW IT ALL STARTED ?  
It was around WW1, US and soviet union were leading as tech giant -> first satellite -> Russia won launching sputnik(1st satellite) in 1957,   
In response US Army created ARPA(Advanced research project agency) to develop new tech and bring america back on top, as they were worried of nuclear attack from soviets.  
So ARPA as a protecting emergency system connection was made b/w 4 scientific universities :  
    
    Stanford, MIT, University of UTAH, UCLA
