# SUBNET MASK
Divides an IP address into two parts:  
- Network part & Host part
- Helps devices figure out if the destination is in the same network or needs to be sent to a router.
- Allows large networks to be broken into smaller, manageable sub-networks
- Reduces network traffic by limiting broadcast domains.
