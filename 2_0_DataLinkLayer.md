# <center> DATA LINK LAYER

Second Layer  
Receives services from physical and provides services to network layer

---
#### FUNCTIONALITIES ?
- **Node to Node Delivery** : Next jump on which node
- **Flow Control** : How much node can handle  
- **Error Control** : Checks at node
- **Access Contol** : Which device can use the communication channel at any given time
- **Physical Addressing** : Adds MAC Address to frames
- **Framing**

#### DESIGN ISSUES
- How to divide data into frames (Framing)?
- How to detect and correct errors (Error Control)?
- How to prevent the receiver from being overloaded (Flow Control)?
- How to control who sends data when the medium is shared (MAC)?
