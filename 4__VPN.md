# VPN

A secure communication channel created over a public network  
It allows users to access private networks and securely transmit data

### How VPN Works:
1. User connects to a VPN client (software). 
2. The client creates an **encrypted tunnel** between the user and a VPN server.
3. All data sent through this tunnel is encrypted and appears to come from the VPN server.
4. The destination (e.g., website) sees the VPN serverâ€™s IP, not the user's real IP.

### Types- 
1. Remote :  
enables a single user to connect to a private network from a remote location
2. Site-to-Site :  
creates a secure connection between two or more physical locations
3. Cloud :  
leverages cloud infrastructure to provide secure VPN connections.
