# FIBER OPTIC CABLE
high-speed data transmission medium  
uses light pulses to transmit data instead of electricity  
#### Structure of a Fiber Optic Cable
- Core – The innermost glass (or plastic) fiber where light travels.
- Cladding – A reflective layer that keeps the light signals within the core by total internal reflection.
- Buffer Coating – Protective outer layer to prevent damage.
- Strengthening Material – Kevlar or similar materials to provide strength.
- Outer Jacket – Final protective layer.
