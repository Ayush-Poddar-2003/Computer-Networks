INTERDOMAIN : Different Networks

### RIP (DISTANCE VECTOR ROUTING)
-	Routers share information with direct neighbors
1. Initialization: 
   - Each router knows only about its directly connected neighbors.
   - Distance to itself = 0; to others = âˆž.
2. Update:
   - Each router sends its routing table to neighbors.
   - Routers update their tables based on the received information:  
`New Distance = Distance to neighbor + neighbor's distance to destination`

### OSPF (LINK STATE ROUTING)
Open Shortest Path First  
uses the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path.
