# TRANSMISSON IMPAIRMENT  ✅

### <CENTER>1. Attenuation (Signal Loss)
- Reduction in signal strength as it travels through a medium.  
- Cause: Resistance of wire, Long distances  
- Solution:Use amplifiers (analog signal) or repeaters (digital signal)  
- Use optical fibers for long-distance, low-loss transmission

Attenuation is measured in decibels (dB) using:
```math
\text{Attenuation (dB)} = 10 \log_{10} \left(\frac{P_{in}}{P_{out}}\right)
]
```

### <CENTER>2. Distortion (Signal Shape Changes)
- Change in signal form or shape as it travels.  
- Cause: Different components of the signal (frequencies) travel at different speeds   
- Solution: Equalization, Use of modulation and filtering techniques

### 3. Noise (Unwanted Signals)

Random electrical signals that interfere with the transmitted signal.

| Type of Noise       | Description                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Thermal Noise**   | Random electron motion due to heat           |
| **Crosstalk**       | Signal leakage from one wire to another      |
| **Intermodulation** | Mixing of different signal frequencies       |
| **Impulse Noise**   | Sudden spikes (e.g., lightning, power surge) |

Solution: Shielded cables, Proper grounding, Error detection and correction codes  
Thermal noise is also called white noise and is present in all devices.
